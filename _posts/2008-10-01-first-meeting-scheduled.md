After much work by several people, we finally have an official date for the very first [Rhode Island Ruby User Group][1] meeting.

Monday, October 27, 2008 we will be holding the first meeting at [OfficeLab][2] in Providence, RI. OfficeLab is located at [170 Westminster St.][3] in the old Federal Reserve building.

The meeting will run from roughly 6pm – 8pm but you can start showing up around 5:30.

[Addison-Wesley][4] has been very gracious in sponsoring the first meeting. We will have several books from their *Professional Ruby Series* to give away as well as discounts and a free pass to the upcoming [Voices That Matter: Professional Ruby Conference][5] in Boston this November.

If you haven’t yet, please join the [RIRUG Google Group][1] and participate in the discussions taking place there.

If you plan to attend the first meeting, please reply either here below or on the Google Group mailing list so we can properly anticipate how many will show up.

If you are interested in giving a short (or long) presentation at the first or any future meetings, please let me know as well so I can coordinate that with you.

Hope to see you all there!
