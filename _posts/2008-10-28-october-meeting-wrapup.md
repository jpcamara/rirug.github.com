First of all, I want to thank everyone who showed out last night. We had a great turnout for the inaugural meeting and I’m looking forward to the future meetings. The next two months will be a bit difficult for meeting planning as I’m sure most everyone has plans for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. We may just try to do one meeting for Nov-Dec sometime in early December.

If you haven’t yet, please [signup for the RIRUG Google Group mailing list][1]. The mailing list is where most discussion regarding meeting planning will happen and is also a great place for you to stay in touch with the Ruby community here in RI. Use the mailing list as a way to pick each others brains on development issues, new ideas, and anything else that crosses your mind.

Thanks to [Matt Gillooly][2] for talking about his experience during [RailsRumble2008][3] and the Twitter client they created, [Twalala][4]. I’ve embedded the Sinatra Presentation I gave last night below. You can also [download the full presentation at SlideShare][5]. If you have any questions about Sinatra or Haml just send a note to the mailing list.

I want to give another huge thanks again to [Wayne Franklin][11] for letting us use the beautiful [OfficeLAB][12] space last night to host our meeting. If you or someone you know is looking for some co-working office space or needs a conference room to use, please get in touch with Wayne and utilize the great location he has setup.
