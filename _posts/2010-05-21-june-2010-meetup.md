The next RIRUG meetup has been scheduled for Wednesday, June 23, 2010 from 6-8 pm.

Our plans this time are to switch things up a bit and do a bit of coding in addition to the regular presentations and discussions. So, everyone bring your laptop and any projects you want to work on, and we’ll spend some good time working on a few different OSS projects. 

This month we’ll be meeting at the new offices of [Mojo Tech][1], right on the water in Warren, RI.

The meeting is scheduled to run from roughly 6-8pm, but feel free to begin showing up anytime after 5:30. Pizza and soda will be provided.

If anyone would like to give a quick (or long) talk about anything Ruby-related, please let me know via [the RIRUG mailing list][2] or by leaving a comment below.
