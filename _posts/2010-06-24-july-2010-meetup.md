The next RIRUG meetup has been scheduled for Wednesday, July 21, 2010 from 6-8 pm.

This month we’ll be meeting at [BatchBlue’s][1] new office location – [Batchhaus][2] in Providence, RI at 10 Elmgrove Ave.

The meeting is scheduled to run from roughly 6-8pm, but feel free to begin showing up anytime after 5:45.

As always, if anyone would like to give a quick (or long) talk about anything Ruby-related, please let me know via [the RIRUG mailing list][3] or by leaving a comment below.

If time is available after presentation, we’ll do some project coding, so bring your laptops.
