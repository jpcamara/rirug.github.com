We will not be having a formal RIRUG meeting for December. Several things just didn’t come together, mostly because of the busy holiday season, so we will not be having a formal meeting with presentations.

I do want to put the call out though to gauge interest in having a more informal “hackfest” type meetup for December. Just a time where we all can get together and work on some personal code and projects and just share ideas. No rules other than “no professional day job work allowed.”

If you are interested, please either leave a comment here or on the official [RIRUG google group mailing list][1].
