Thanks to everyone who attended the March meeting, and special thanks to Batchblue for hosting and providing pizza and drinks. 

During the meeting we discussed structuring Javascript in larger applications, touching on Backbone, and CoffeeScript. Eric Krause and Joe Alba gave a recap of their trip to RailsConf this year in Austin, TX. A few of the talks they recommended watching included the Keynote, "Let's make the web faster â€“ tips from trenches @ Google" by Ilya Grigorik, and "Ten Things You Didn't Know Rails Could Do" by James Edward Gray II. These videos can be viewed on

The presentation last night covered converting an existing Javascript library into a jQuery plugin. Here are the slides from the presentation:
