On Wednesday, April 17th, PJ Hagerty from Engine Yard will be in town to discuss ways we can grow and contribute to our group -- and in doing so contribute to the Ruby community at large.

The WNY Ruby Group isn't just succeeding because they have local celebs like Nick Quaranto, Wayne Seguin and PJ.  They're also putting good effort into it.  I'm looking forward to learning from their success.
