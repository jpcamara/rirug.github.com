Believe it or not, RIRUG is back in action and we will be holding our next meeting on Thursday, January 28, 2010.

Topics will most likely include [Cerberus Continuous Integration][1] and [MongoDB.][2]

 [1]: http://cerberus.rubyforge.org/
 [2]: http://www.mongodb.org

Weâ€™ll meetup at the **[BatchBlue][3]** headquarters. BatchBlue is located at 131 Wayland Avenue, Providence RI.

You can show up anytime between 6-7 PM. Go to the side of the building and you will see some glass doors with a small BatchBlue sticker on them. Do not go to the top floor as that is Working Planet; BatchBlue is in the basement. 

[RIRUG Google Groups mailing list][4] so we have a decent idea of how many folks to expect.

Hope to see you there, and thanks to BatchBlue for providing the space again.
