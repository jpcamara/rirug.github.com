We are hoping to plan and hold the first **RI Ruby User Group** sometime this October.

We still have a bit of work to do on the planning side – mainly lining up volunteers to speak and finding a date and location.

We’ll need a few people to volunteer to give a short talk or presentation since I haven’t been able to line a guest speaker up yet. The more volunteers the shorter everyone needs to talk. Maybe the first meeting can just be a simple “Drop your Pants” session where everyone gives a blitz talk on what projects they are currently working on??

Ideas? Comments? Suggestions?

Leave a comment if you are willing to give a talk and/or if you have any suggestions on a venue for the meetup.

Here is the [original discussion thread on RI Nexus as well][1].
