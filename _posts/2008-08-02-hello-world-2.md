After a few [posts back and forth on RINexus][1] I hope that the first official Rhode Island Ruby User Group is about to form.

We are still in the very early stages and are mostly gauging interest in forming such a group here in the Ocean State. No official meeting place or dates have been made yet but this site will be updated as new details become available.
